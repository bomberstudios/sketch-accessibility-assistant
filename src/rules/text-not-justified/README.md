# ```text-not-justified```

## Specifies which text layers use justified text-alignment.

### Rationale
> Justification impacts readability and tracking. Sometimes full justification makes reading more difficult because extra space between words causes "rivers of white" making it difficult to track along a line of text, or less space between words makes it difficult to distinguish separate words.
